              <p>
                Every once and a while I stumble upon a band that really captures my attention.  Few have done so quite as much as Still Woozy has in recent memory.  I remember Wolfcat coming up on a spotify radio station while i was on my way to see Jungle at the ventura majestic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The the project still seems to be in its infancy as there still isn't even a formal album released.  they've put out some good stuff so far, so go ahead and check them out if you have the chance.
